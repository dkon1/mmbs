<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All living things change over time, and this evolution can be
quantitatively measured and analyzed. Mathematics makes use of equations
to define models that change with time, known as <em>dynamical systems</em>. In
this unit we will learn how to construct models that describe the
time-dependent behavior of some measurable quantity in life sciences.
Numerous fields of biology use such models, and in particular we will
consider changes in population size, the progress of biochemical
reactions, the spread of infectious disease, and the spikes of membrane
potentials in neurons, as some of the main examples of biological
dynamical systems.</p>
<p>Many processes in living things happen regularly, repeating with a
fairly constant time period. One common example is the reproductive
cycle in species that reproduce periodically, whether once a year, or
once an hour, like certain bacteria that divide at a relatively constant
rate under favorable conditions. Other periodic phenomena include
circadian (daily) cycles in physiology, contractions of the heart
muscle, and waves of neural activity. For these processes, theoretical
biologists use models with <em>discrete time</em>, in which the time variable
is restricted to the integers. For instance, it is natural to count the
generations in whole numbers when modeling population growth.</p>
<p>This chapter is devoted to analyzing dynamical systems in which time is
measured in discrete steps. It supposes that you have been exposed to
linear one-variable difference equations before, and the first section
briefly summarizes building and solving linear difference equations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linear-discrete-time-population-models">
<h2>Linear discrete time population models<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-discrete-time-population-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let us construct our first models of biological systems. We will start
by considering a population of some species, with the goal of tracking
its growth or decay over time. The variable of interest is the number of
individuals in the population, which we will call <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>. This is called
the dependent variable, since its value changes depending on time; it
would make no sense to say that time changes depending on the population
size. Throughout the study of dynamical systems, we will denote the
independent variable of time by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>. To denote the population size at
time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, we can write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> but sometimes use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_t\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="static-population">
<h3>static population<a class="headerlink" href="#static-population" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to describe the dynamics, we need to write down a rule for how
the population changes. Consider the simplest case, in which the
population stays the same for all time. (Maybe it is a pile of rocks?)
Then the following equation describes this situation: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = N(t)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
This equation mandates that the population at the next time step be the
same as at the present time \)</span>t<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. This type of equation is generally
called a *difference equation*, because it can be written as a
difference between the values at the two different times:
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) - N(t) = 0\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( This version of the model illustrates that a
difference equation at its core describes the *increments* of \)</span>N$ from
one time step to the next. In this case, the increments are always 0,
which makes it plain that the population does not change from one time
step to the next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exponential-population-growth">
<h3>exponential population growth<a class="headerlink" href="#exponential-population-growth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let us consider a more interesting situation: as a colony of dividing
bacteria. such as <em>E. coli</em>, shown in figure 1. We
will assume that each bacterial cell divides and produces two daughter
cells at fixed intervals of time, and let us further suppose that
bacteria never die. Essentially, we are assuming a population of
immortal bacteria with clocks. This means that after each cell division
the population size doubles. As before, we denote the number of cells in
each generation by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span>, and obtain the equation describing each
successive generation: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = 2N(t)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( It can also be written in the
difference form, as above: \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) - N(t) = N(t)\)</span>$ The increment in
population size is determined by the current population size, so the
population in this model is forever growing. This type of behavior is
termed <em>exponential growth</em> and we will see how to express the solution
algebraically in the next section.</p>

<h3>example with birth and death<a class="headerlink" href="#example-with-birth-and-death" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Suppose that a type of fish lives to reproduce only once after a period
of maturation, after which the adults die. In this simple scenario, half
of the population is female, a female always lays 1000 eggs, and of
those, 1% survive to maturity and reproduce. Let us set up the model for
the population growth of this idealized fish population. The general
idea, as before, is to relate the population size at the next time step
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1)\)</span> to the population at the present time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us tabulate both the increases and the decreases in the population
size. We have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> fish at the present time, but we know they all die
after reproducing, so there is a decrease of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> in the population.
Since half of the population is female, the number of new offspring
produced by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> fish is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(500N(t)\)</span>. Of those, only 1% survive to
maturity (the next time step), and the other 99% (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(495N(t)\)</span>) die. We can
add all the terms together to obtain the following difference equation:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = N(t) - N(t) + 500N(t) - 495 N(t)  = 5N(t)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( The number 500 in
the expression is the *birth rate* of the population per individual, and
the negative terms add up to the *death rate* of 496 per individual. We
can re-write the equation in difference form: \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) - N(t) = 4N(t)\)</span>$
This expression again generates growth in the population, because the
birth rate outweighs the death rate. [&#64;allman_mathematical_2003]</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dimensions-of-birth-and-death-rates">
<h3>dimensions of birth and death rates<a class="headerlink" href="#dimensions-of-birth-and-death-rates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>What distinguishes a mathematical model from a mathematical equation is
that the quantities involved have a real-world meaning. Each quantity
represents a measurement, and associated with each one are the <em>units</em>
of measurement, which are familiar from science courses. In addition to
units, each variable and parameter has a meaning, which is called the
<em>dimension</em> of the quantity. For example, any measurement of length or
distance has the same dimension, although the units may vary. The value
of a quantity depends on the units of measurement, but its essential
dimensionality does not. One can convert a measurement in meters to that
in light-years or cubits, but one cannot convert a measurement in number
of sheep to seconds - that conversion has no meaning.</p>
<p>Thus leads us to the fundamental rule of mathematical modeling: <strong>terms
that are added or subtracted must have the same dimension</strong>. This gives
mathematical modelers a useful tool called <em>dimensional analysis</em>, which
involves replacing the quantities in an equation with their dimensions.
This serves as a check that all dimensions match, as well as allowing to
deduce the dimensions of any parameters for which the dimension was not
specified.</p>
<p>In the case of population models, the birth and death rates measure the
number of individuals that are born (or die) within a reproductive cycle
for every individual at the present time. Their dimensions must be such
that the terms in the equation all match:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([N(t+1) - N(t)] = [population] = [r] [N(t)] = [r] *[population]\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( This
implies that \)</span>[r]<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is algebraically dimensionless. However, the meaning
of \)</span>r<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is the rate of change of population over one (generation) time
step. \)</span>r$ is the birth or death rate of the population <em>per generation</em>,
and therefore, when such rates are measured, they are reported with
units of inverse time (e.g. number of offspring per year).</p>
<p>We will now write a general difference equation for any population with
constant birth and death rates. This will allow us to substitute
arbitrary values of the birth and death rates to model different
biological situations. Suppose that a population has the birth rate of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> per individual, and the death rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> per individual. Then the
general model of the population size is: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = (1 + b - d)N(t)
 \label{linear_pop}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( The general equation also allows us to check the
dimensions of birth and death rates, especially as written in the
incremental form: \)</span> N(t+1) - N(t) = (b - d)N(t)$. The change in
population rate over one reproductive cycle is given by the current
population size multiplied by the difference of birth and death rates,
which as we saw are algebraically dimensionless. The right hand side of
the equation has the dimensions of population size, matching the
difference on the left hand side. [&#64;edelstein-keshet_mathematical_2005]</p>

<h3>simple linear difference models<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-linear-difference-models" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Having set up the difference equation models, we would naturally like to
solve them to find out how the dependent variable, such as population
size, varies over time. A solution may be <em>analytical</em>, meaning that it
can be written as a formula, or <em>numerical</em>, in which case it is
generated by a computer in the form of a sequence of values of the
dependent variable over a period of time. In this section, we will find
some simple analytic solutions and learn to analyze the behavior of
difference equations which we cannot solve exactly.</p>
<p>A function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> is a <em>solution</em> (over some time period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a &lt; t &lt; b\)</span>) of
a difference equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = f(N(t))\)</span> if it satisfies that equation
(over some time period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a &lt; t &lt; b\)</span>). [def:math14_sol]</p>
<p>For instance, let us take our first model of the static population,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( N(t+1) = N(t)\)</span>. Any constant function is a solution, for example,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t) = 0\)</span>, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t) = 10\)</span>. There are actually as many solutions as
there are numbers, that is, infinitely many! In order to specify exactly
what happens in the model, we need to specify the size of the population
at some point, usually, at the “beginning of time”, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t = 0\)</span>. This is
called the <em>initial condition</em> for the model, and for a well-behaved
difference equation it is enough to determine a unique solution. For the
static model, specifying the initial condition is the same as specifying
the population size for all time.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the general model of population growth with constant
birth and death rates. We saw in equation [linear_pop] above that
these can be written in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = (1 + b - d) N(t)\)</span>. To
simplify, let us combine the numbers into one growth parameter
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = 1 + b - d\)</span>, and write down the general equation for population
growth with constant growth rate: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) =  rN(t)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( To find the
solution, consider a specific example, where we start with the initial
population size \)</span>N_0 = 1<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(, and the growth rate \)</span>r=2<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. The sequence of
population sizes is: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. This is described by the
formula \)</span>N(t) = 2^t$.</p>
<p>In the general case, each time step the solution is multiplied by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>,
so the solution has the same exponential form. The initial condition
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_0\)</span> is a multiplicative constant in the solution, and one can verify
that when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t=0\)</span>, the solution matches the initial value:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)  = r^t N_0
\label{eq:lin_discrete_sol}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( I would like the reader to pause and
consider this remarkable formula. No matter what the birth and death
parameters are selected, this solution predicts the population size at
any point in time \)</span>t$.</p>
<p>In order to verify that the formula for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> is actually a solution in
the meaning of definition [def:math14_sol], we need to check that it
actually satisfies the difference equation for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, not just a few
time steps. This can be done algebraically by plugging in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1)\)</span> into
the left side of the dynamic model and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> into the right side and
checking whether they match. For <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> given by equation
[eq:lin_discrete_sol], <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = r^{t+1} N_0\)</span>, and thus the dynamic
model becomes: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{t+1} N_0 = r*r^t N_0\)</span>$ Since the two sides match,
this means the solution is correct.</p>
<p>The solutions in formula [eq:lin_discrete_sol] are exponential
functions, which have a limited menu of behaviors, depending on the
value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r &gt; 1\)</span>, multiplication by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> increases the size of
the population, so the solution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> will grow. If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r &lt; 1\)</span>,
multiplication by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> decreases the size of the population, so the
solution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t)\)</span> will decay (see figure ). Finally, if
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=1\)</span>, multiplication by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> leaves the population size unchanged, like
in the pile of rocks model. Here is the complete classification of the
behavior of population models with constant birth and death rates
(assuming <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&gt;0\)</span>):</p>

<h3>linear difference models with a constant term<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-difference-models-with-a-constant-term" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now let us consider a dynamic model that combines two different rates: a
proportional rate (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(rN\)</span>) and a constant rate which does not depend on
the value of the variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>. We can write such a generic model as
follows: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) =  rN(t) + a\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( The right-hand-side of this equation is
a linear function of \)</span>N<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(, so this is a linear difference equation with a
constant term. What function \)</span>N(t)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( satisfies it? One can quickly check
that that the same solution \)</span>N(t) = r^t N_0<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( does not work because of
the pesky constant term \)</span>a<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(: \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r^{t+1} N_0 \neq r*r^t N_0 + a\)</span>$</p>
<p>To solve it, we need to try a different form: specifically, an
exponential with an added constant. The exponential can be reasonably
surmised to have base <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> as before, and then leave the two constants as
unknown: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t) = c_1 r^t + c_2\)</span>. To figure out whether this is a
solution, plug it into the linear difference equation above and check
whether a choice of constants can make the two sides agree:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) =  c_1 r^{t +1} + c_2 = rN(t) + a  = rc_1 r^t + rc_2+ a\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( This
equation has the same term \)</span>c_1 r^{t +1}<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( on both sides, so they can be
subtracted out. The remaining equation involves only \)</span>c_2<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(, and its
solution is \)</span>c_2 = a/(1-r)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. Therefore, the general solution of this
linear difference equation is the following expreis which is determined
from the initial value by plugging \)</span>t=0<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and solving for \)</span>c<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(.
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t) = c r^t  + \frac{a}{1-r}
\label{eq:ch14_sol_wconst}\)</span>$</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Take the difference equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = 0.5 N(t) + 40\)</span> with
initial value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(0)= 100\)</span>. The solution, according to our formula is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t) = c 0.5^t + 80\)</span>. At <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(0) = 100 = c+80\)</span>, so <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c=20\)</span>. Then the
compete solution is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t) = 20*0.5^t + 80\)</span>. To check that this actually
works, plug this solution back into the difference equation:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = 20*0.5^{t+1} + 80 = 0.5*(20*0.5^t + 80) + 40 =  20*0.5^{t+1} + 80\)</span>$
The equation is satisfied and therefore the solution is correct.</p>

<h3>logistic population model<a class="headerlink" href="#logistic-population-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We will now encounter and analyze the famous discrete-time logistic
model. Its assumptions are very similar to those used to derive the
logistic ODE. We arbitrarily choose a simple non-constant relationship
between the birth and death rates and the size of the population:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b =  b_1 - b_2 N(t) ; \;   d = d_1 + d_2 N(t)\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( We model both the
birth and death rates as linear functions of population size, but with
the birth rate declining and the death rate increasing with larger
population size. We can now substitute these birth rates into the

simpler way of writing this equation is to let \)</span>r = 1 + b_1 - d_1<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and
\)</span>K = b_2 + d_2<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(, leading to the following iterated map:
\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = (r - K N(t)) N(t)

increasing population on the population growth rate. Let us analyze the
dimensions of the two parameters, by writing down the dimensions of the
variables of the difference equation. The dimensional equation is:

\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(= ([r]  - [K] *[population])*[population]\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Matching the dimensions on

for the logistic model is <em>nonlinear</em>, because it includes a second
power of the dependent variable. In general, it is difficult to solve
nonlinear equations, but we can still say a lot about this model’s

<div class="section" id="equilibrium-values-or-fixed-points">
<h3>equilibrium values or fixed points<a class="headerlink" href="#equilibrium-values-or-fixed-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have seen that the solutions of difference equations depend on the
initial value of the dependent variable. In the examples we have seen so
far, the long-term behavior of the solution does not depend dramatically
on the initial condition. In more complex systems that we will
encounter, there are special values of the dependent variable for which
the dynamical system is constant, like in the pile of rocks model.</p>
<p>For a difference equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X(t+1) = f(X(t))\)</span>, a point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X^*\)</span> which
satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(X^*)=X^*\)</span> is called a <em>fixed point</em> or <em>equilibrium</em>. If
the initial condition is a fixed point, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_0=X^*\)</span>, the solution will
stay at the same value for all time, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X(t)=X^*\)</span>.</p>
<p>The reason these special points are also known as equilibria is due to
the precise balance between growth and decay that is mandated at a fixed
point. In terms of population modeling, at an equilibrium the birth
rates and the death rates are equal. Speaking analytically, in order to
find the fixed points of a difference equation, one must solve the
equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(X^*) = X^*\)</span>. It may have none, or one, or many solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> The linear population models which we analyzed in the last
chapter have the mathematical form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1)= r N(t)\)</span> (where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> can be
any real number). Then the only fixed point of those models is
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^* = 0\)</span>, that is, a population with no individuals. If there are any
individuals present, we know that the population will grow to infinity
if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|r| &gt; 1\)</span>, and decay to 0 if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|r| &lt; 1\)</span>. This is true even for the
smallest population size, as long as it is not exactly zero.</p>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Let us go back to the example of a linear difference
equation with a constant term. The equation is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( N(t+1) = -0.5N(t) +10\)</span>,
and we saw that the numerical solutions all converged to the same value,
regardless of the initial value. Let us find the equilibrium value of
this model using the definition:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^* = -0.5N^* +10 \Rightarrow 1.5 N^* = 10  \Rightarrow N^* = 10/1.5 = 20/3\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
If the initial value is equal to the equilibrium, \)</span>N(0)= 20/3<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(, then the
solution will remain constant for all time, since the next value
\)</span>N(t+1) = -0.5*20/3+10 = 20/3$ remains the same.</p>
<p><strong>Example: discrete logistic model.</strong> Let us use the simplified version
of the logistic equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = r(1 - N(t)) N(t)\)</span> and set the
right-hand side function equal to the variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> to find the fixed
points <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^*\)</span>: $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r(1 - N^*) N^* = N^*\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( There are two solutions to this
equation, \)</span>N^* = 0<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and \)</span>N^* = (r-1)/r$. These are the fixed points or
the equilibrium population sizes for the model, the first being the
obvious case when the population is extinct. The second equilibrium is
more interesting, as it describes the <em>carrying capacity</em> of a
population in a particular environment. If the initial value is equal to
either of the two fixed points, the solution will remain at that same
value for all time. But what happens to solutions which do not start a
fixed point? Do they converge to a fixed point, and if so, to which one?</p>

<div class="section" id="stability-criteria-for-fixed-points">
<h3>stability criteria for fixed points<a class="headerlink" href="#stability-criteria-for-fixed-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>What happens to the solution of a dynamical system if the initial
condition is very close to an equilibrium, but not precisely at it? Put
another way, what happens if the equilibrium is <em>perturbed</em>? To answer
the question, we will no longer confine ourselves to the integers, to be
interpreted as population sizes. We will instead consider, abstractly,
what happens if the smallest perturbation is added to a fixed point.
Will the solution tend to return to the fixed point or tend to move away
from it? The answer to this question is formalized in the following
definition [&#64;strogatz_nonlinear_2001]:</p>
<p>For a difference equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X(t+1) = f(X(t))\)</span>, a fixed point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X^*\)</span> is
<em>stable</em> if for a sufficiently small number <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span>, the solution
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X(t)\)</span> with the initial condition <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_0 = X^* + \epsilon\)</span> approaches the
fixed point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X^*\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t \rightarrow \infty\)</span>. If the solution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X(t)\)</span> does
not approach <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X^*\)</span> for any nonzero <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon\)</span>, the fixed point is called
<em>unstable</em>.</p>
<p>The notion of stability is central to the study of dynamical systems.
Typically, models more complex than those we have seen cannot be solved
analytically. Finding the fixed points and determining their stability
can help us understand the general behavior of solutions without writing
them down. For instance, we know that solutions never approach an
unstable fixed point, whereas for a stable fixed point the solutions
will tend to it, from some range of initial conditions.</p>
<p>There is a mathematical test to determine the stability of a fixed
point. From standard calculus comes the Taylor expansion, which
approximates the value of a function near a given point. Take a general
difference equation written in terms of some function
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X(t+1) = f(X(t))\)</span>. Let us define the <em>deviation</em> from the fixed point
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X^*\)</span> at time <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon(t) = x_{t} - X^*\)</span>. Then we can use the
linear (first-order) Taylor approximation at the fixed point and write
down the following expression:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X(t+1) = f(X^*) + \epsilon(t) f'(X^*) + ...\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( The ellipsis means that
the expression is approximate, with terms of order \)</span>\epsilon(t)^2<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and
higher swept under the rug. Since we take \)</span> \epsilon(t)<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( to be small,
those terms are very small and can be neglected. Since \)</span>X^<em><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is a fixed
point, \)</span> f(X^</em>) = X^<em><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(. Thus, we can write the following difference
equation to describe the behavior of the deviation from the fixed point
\)</span>X^</em><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(: \)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X(t+1) -  X^* =  \epsilon(t+1)= \epsilon(t) f'(X^*)\)</span>$</p>
<p>We see that we started out with a general function defining the
difference equation and transformed it into a linear equation for the
deviation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span>. Note that the multiplicative constant here is
the derivative of the function at the fixed point: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f'(X^*)\)</span>. This is
called the <em>linearization</em> approach, which is an approximation of a
dynamical system near a fixed point with a linear equation for the small
perturbation.</p>
<p>We found the solution to simple linear equations, which we can use
describe the behavior of the perturbation to the fixed point. The
behavior <strong>depends on the value of the derivative of the updating
function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f'(X^*)\)</span>:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|f'(X^*)| &gt; 1\)</span>: the deviation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> grows, and the solution
moves away from the fixed point; fixed point is <em>unstable</em></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|f'(X^*)| &lt; 1\)</span>: the deviation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\epsilon(t)\)</span> decays, and the
solution approaches the fixed point; fixed point is <em>stable</em></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|f'(X^*)| = 1 \)</span>: the fixed point may be stable or unstable, and
more information is needed</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We now know how to determine the stability of a fixed point, so let us
apply this method to some examples.</p>
<p><strong>Example: linear difference equations.</strong> Let us analyze the stability
of the fixed point of a linear difference equation, e.g.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( N(t+1) = -0.5N(t) +10\)</span>. The derivative of the updating function is
equal to -0.5. Because it is less than 1 in absolute value, the fixed
point is stable, so solutions converge to this equilibrium. We can state
more generally that any linear difference equation of the form
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N(t+1) = aN(t) + b\)</span> has one fixed point, which is equal to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^* = b/(1-a)\)</span>. This fixed point is stable if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|a| &lt;1\)</span> and unstable if
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(|a|&gt;1\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Example: discrete logistic model.</strong> In the last subsection we found
the fixed points of the simplified logistic model. To determine what
happens to the solution, we need to determine the stability of both
equilibria. Since the stability of fixed points is determined by the
derivative of the defining function at the fixed points, we compute the
derivative of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(N) = rN-rN^2\)</span> to be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f'(N) = r-2rN\)</span>, and evaluate it at
the two fixed points <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^* = 0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^* = (r-1)/r\)</span>:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f'(0) = r; \; \; f'((r-1)/r) = r-2(r-1) = 2-r\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Because the intrinsic
death rate cannot be greater than the birth rate, we know that \)</span>r&gt;0$.
Therefore, we have the following <em>stability conditions</em> for the two
fixed points:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the fixed point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^*=0\)</span> is stable for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&lt;1\)</span>, and unstable for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&gt;1\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>the fixed point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^*= (r-1)/r\)</span> is stable for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1&lt;r&lt;3\)</span>, and unstable
otherwise.</p></li>

<p>Difference equations, as we saw above, can be written in the form of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{t+1} = f(x_t)\)</span>. At every step, the model takes the current value of
the dependent variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_t\)</span>, feeds it into the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span>, and
takes the output as the next value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{t+1}\)</span>. The same process repeats
every iteration, which is why difference equations written in this form
are called <em>iterated maps</em>.</p>
<p>Computers are naturally suited for precise, repetitive operations. In
our first example of a computational algorithm, we will iterate a given
function to produce a sequence of values of the dependent variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
We only need two things: to specify a computer function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span>, which
returns the value of the iterated map for any input value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, and the
initial value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_0\)</span>. Then it is a matter of repeating the operation of
evaluating <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x_t)\)</span> and storing it as the next value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_{t+1}\)</span>. Below is
the pseudocode for the algorithm. Note that I will use arrows to
indicated variable assignment, square brackets <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([]\)</span> for indexing of
vector, and start indexing at 0, consistent with python convention.</p>
<p>define the iterated map function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(x)\)</span> set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Niter\)</span> to be the number of

<p>The resulting sequence of values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_0, x_1, x_2, ... , x_N\)</span> is called a
<em>numerical solution</em> of the given difference equation. It has two
disadvantages compared to an analytic solution: first, the solution can
only be obtained for a specific initial value and number of iterations,
and second, any computer simulation inevitably introduces some errors,
for instance from round-off. In practice, however, most complex
dynamical systems have to solved numerically, as analytical solutions
are difficult or impossible to find.</p>

can be gleaned by plotting the graph of the defining function of an
iterated map <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_{t+1} = f(X_t)\)</span>. We have already seen some of the
concepts in the previous analytical section. Here is a summary of what
we can learn from the graph of the function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span>:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The location of the fixed points of the iterated map. Since the

<li><p>The stability of fixed points. We learned that the derivative of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span> at a fixed point determines its stability. Graphically, this
means that the slope of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span> at the point of intersection with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=x\)</span> can be used for this purpose; if it is steeper (in absolute
value) than the straight line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=x\)</span>, then the fixed point is
unstable, but if its slope is less than one in absolute value, the
equilibrium is stable.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphical iteration of the difference equation. The value of the
function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span> gives the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> at the next time step, and
this fact can be used to produce a graph of successive values of the
dependent variable: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_0, x_1, x_2, ...\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let us exploit the idea in the third point for graphical analysis of an
iterated map. Starting with some initial condition <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_0\)</span>, the value of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1\)</span> is given by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x_0)\)</span>. To show this graphically, starting the point
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_0\)</span> on the axis, draw a vertical line to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=f(x_0)\)</span>. Next, draw a
horizontal line to the graph of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=x\)</span>. Since the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> coordinates
are equal, we now have the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1 = f(x_0)\)</span> as the x coordinate.
Then, repeat the process by drawing a vertical line to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=f(x_1)\)</span>, and
the a horizontal line <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=x\)</span>, etc. The resulting sequence of x
coordinates is a quick way of assessing the dynamics of the iterated
map. For instance, the values may converge to a fixed point, or grow to
infinity, or bounce around without settling down. The resulting graph of
alternating vertical and horizontal line segments is called a cobweb
plot, and we will see its usefulness in the synthesis section. We now
have at our disposal analytical, numerical, and graphical tools to
analyze and predict the behavior of a dynamical system. In the next
section we will use all three to analyze a more complex model of
population growth.</p>

<div class="section" id="rescaling-the-logistic-model">
<h3>rescaling the logistic model<a class="headerlink" href="#rescaling-the-logistic-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First, let us do one more modification of the model, by taking the
parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> as the common multiple:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N_{t+1} = r(1 - \frac{K}{r} N_t) N_t
\label{discrete_logistic2}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( As we saw, the parameter \)</span>K<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( has dimension
of inverse population size, and that the parameter \)</span>r<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is dimensionless.
We can now use rescaling of the variable \)</span>N$ to simplify the logistic
model. The goal is to reduce the number of parameters, by canceling
some, and bringing the rest into one place, where they can be combined
into a <em>dimensionless group</em>. Here is how this is accomplished for this
model:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Pick a number of the same dimension as the variable, called the
scale, and divide the variable by it. In this case, let the scale
for population be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r/K\)</span>, so then the new variable is
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde N = \frac{NK}{r}  \Longrightarrow N = \frac{\tilde N r}{ K }\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
Since the parameter \)</span>K<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( has dimension of inverse population size,
\)</span>NK<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( is in the dimensionless variable \)</span>\tilde N$.</p></li>
<li><p>Substitute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( \tilde N / K \)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> in the equation:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{\tilde N_{t+1}r }{ K} = r\left(1  -\frac{ K \tilde N_t  r}{rK} \right) \frac{\tilde N_t r} { K}\)</span>$</p></li>
<li><p>Canceling all the parameters on both sides, we just have the
dimensionless growth rate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, as our only parameter:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde N_{t+1}  = r(1 -\tilde N_t)\tilde N_t\)</span>$</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the surface, we merely used algebraic trickery to simplify the
equation, but the result is actually rather deep. By changing the
dimension of measurement of the population from individuals (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>) to the
dimensionless fraction of the carrying capacity (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tilde N\)</span>) we found
that there is only one parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> that governs the behavior of this
model. We will see in the next two section that varying this parameter
leads to dramatic changes in the dynamics of the model population
[&#64;edelstein-keshet_mathematical_2005].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fixed-point-analysis">
<h3>fixed point analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#fixed-point-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The first step for qualitative analysis of a nonlinear model is to find
the fixed points. We use the dimensionless version of the logistic
equation, and the right-hand side function equal to the value of the
special values <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^*\)</span> (fixed points): $<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r(1 - N^*) N^* = N^*\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( There are
two solutions to this equation, \)</span>N^* = 0<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( and \)</span>N^* = (r-1)/r$. These are
the fixed points or the equilibrium population sizes for the model, the
first being the obvious case when the population is extinct. The second
equilibrium is more interesting, as it describes the <em>carrying capacity</em>
of a population in a particular environment. To determine what happens
to the solution, we need to evaluate the stability of both equilibria.</p>
<p>We have seen in the analytical section that the stability of fixed
points is determined by the derivative of the defining function at the
fixed points. The derivative of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(N) = rN-rN^2\)</span> is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f'(N) = r-2rN\)</span>, and
we evaluate it at the two fixed points:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f'(0) = r; \; \; f'((r-1)/r) = r-2(r-1) = 2-r\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( Because the intrinsic
death rate cannot be greater than the birth rate, we know that \)</span>r&gt;0$.
Therefore, we have the following stability conditions for the two fixed
points:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the fixed point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^*=0\)</span> is stable for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&lt;1\)</span>, and unstable for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&gt;1\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>the fixed point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^*= (r-1)/r\)</span> is stable for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1&lt;r&lt;3\)</span>, and unstable
otherwise.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can plot the solution for the population size of the logistic model
population over time. We see that, depending on the value of the
parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> (but not on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span>), the behavior is dramatically different:
<strong>Case 1: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r &lt; 1\)</span>.</strong> The fixed point at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N ^*= 0\)</span> is stable and the
fixed point is unstable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^* = (r-1)/r\)</span>. The solution tends to 0, or
extinction, regardless of the initial condition, which is illustrated in
figure [fig:sol_logistic_2] for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=0.8\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 &lt; r &lt; 3\)</span>.</strong> The extinction fixed point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N ^*= 0\)</span> is
unstable, but the carrying capacity fixed point <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^* = (r-1)/r\)</span> is
stable. We can conclude that the solution will approach the carrying
capacity for most initial conditions. This was shown in figure
[fig:sol_logistic_1] for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=1.5\)</span> and is illustrated in figure
[fig:sol_logistic_3] for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=2.8\)</span>. Notice that although the solution
approaches the carrying capacity equilibrium in both cases, when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&gt;2\)</span>,
the solution oscillates while converging to its asymptotic value,
foreshadowing the behavior when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&gt;3\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Case 3: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( r &gt; 3\)</span>.</strong> Strange things happen: there are no stable fixed
points, so there is no value for the solution to approach. As we saw in
the previous section, the solution can undergo so-called period two
oscillations, which are shown in figure [fig:sol_logistic_4] with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=3.3\)</span>. However, even stranger behavior is observed when the parameter
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> crosses the threshold of about <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3.59\)</span>. Figure
[fig:sol_logistic_5] shows the behavior of the solution for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=3.6\)</span>,
which is no longer periodic, and instead seems to bounce around without
any discernible pattern. This dynamics is known as <em>chaos</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="graphical-analysis-of-the-logistic-model">
<h3>graphical analysis of the logistic model<a class="headerlink" href="#graphical-analysis-of-the-logistic-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As we saw in section 1.4, we can learn a lot about the behavior of a
dynamical system from analyzing the graph of the defining function. Let
us consider two quadratic functions for the logistic model:
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(N) = 2N(1-N/2)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(N) = 4N(1-N/4)\)</span> .</p>
<p>First, plotting the graphs of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=f(N)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=N\)</span>, allows us to find the
fixed points of the logistic model. Looking at figure X, we see that there are fixed points at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N = 0\)</span>
for both functions, and carrying capacity sizes at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=2\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N=3\)</span>,
respectively. The reader should check that this is in agreement with the
analytic prediction of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N^* = (r-1)/r\)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, we can obtain information about stability of the two fixed
points by considering the slope of the curve <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=f(N)\)</span> at the points
where it crosses <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y=N\)</span>. On the graph of the first function, the slope is
clearly 0, which indicates that the fixed point is stable, in agreement
with the analytical prediction. On the graph of the second function, the
slope is negative and steeper than -1. This indicates that the fixed
point is unstable, again consistent with our analysis above.</p>
<p>Third, we graph a few iterations of the cobweb plot to obtain an idea
about the dynamics of the population over time. As expected, for the
first function with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r=2\)</span>, the solution quickly approaches the carrying
capacity (figure a). In the second function, however, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r = 4\)</span> and the carrying capacity is unstable. In (figure b) we observe a wild pattern of jumps that never approach any particular value.</p>
<p><img alt="Examples of two cobweb plots: a) solution converges to the stablefixed point at the intersection of the graphs of the function and theidentity line; b) solution bounces around the unstable fixed point,producing a cobweb-like plot[]{data-label=&quot;fig:logistic_cobweb&quot;}" src="images/ch1_cobweb_1.png" />
<img alt="Examples of two cobweb plots: a) solution converges to the stablefixed point at the intersection of the graphs of the function and theidentity line; b) solution bounces around the unstable fixed point,producing a cobweb-like plot[]{data-label=&quot;fig:logistic_cobweb&quot;}" src="images/ch1_cobweb_2.png" /></p>
<p>We have seen how graphical tools can be used to analyze and predict the
behavior of a dynamical system. In the case of the logistic model, we
never found the analytic solution, because it frequently does not exist
as a formula. Finding the fixed points and analyzing their stability, in
conjunction with looking at the behavior of a cobweb plot, allowed us to
describe the dynamics of population growth in the logistic model,
without doing any “mathematics”. Together, the analytical and graphical
analysis provide complementary tools for biological modelers.</p>

<div class="section" id="chaos-in-discrete-dynamical-systems">
<h3>chaos in discrete dynamical systems<a class="headerlink" href="#chaos-in-discrete-dynamical-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this chapter we learned to analyze the dynamics of solutions of
nonlinear discrete-time dynamical systems without solving them on paper.
In the last two sections we focused on the logistic difference equation
as a simple nonlinear model with a rich array of dynamic behaviors. In
this section we will summarize the analysis and draw conclusions for
difference equation models in biology. This behavior was brought to the
attention of biologists by John Maynard Smith [&#64;smith_mathematical_1968]
and Robert May [&#64;may_bifurcations_1976].</p>
<p>Why does the logistic model behave so strangely in the second example
above? We can use numerical simulations to plot the long-term solutions
for the dependent variable for a range of parameter values, let us say
between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(2.5 &lt; r &lt; 4\)</span>. Then we plot the values to which the simulation
converged (whether it is one, two, or many) on the y-axis, and the value
of the parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> on the x-axis. The resulting <em>bifurcation diagram</em>
in shown in figure. The value of the parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> is
plotted on the horizontal axis, and the set of values that the dependent
variable takes in the long run is shown on the vertical axis. There is
only one stable fixed point for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r&lt;3\)</span>, then we see a 2-cycle appear for
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3&lt;r&lt;3.45\)</span>. For values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> greater than about 3.45, a series of
period-doubling bifurcations occur with shorter and shorter intervals of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. This is called a <em>period-doubling cascade</em>, which culminates at the
value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r \approx 3.57\)</span>, where the number of points in the cycle
becomes essentially infinite. The sequence of values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> at which
period-doubling occurs is approximately:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>period 2; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_1 = 3\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>period 4; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_2 \approx 3.449\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>period 8; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_3 \approx  3.544\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>period 16; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_4 \approx  3.564\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>period 32; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_5 \approx 3.569\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>period <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\infty\)</span> (chaos); <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_\infty \approx  3.570\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="Bifurcation diagram for the logistic map ,with the parameter  on the horizontal axis and the vertical axisshowing the values of the stable fixed point (for ), then thevalues of the period two oscillation, the period four oscillation, etc.,and for  greater than the critical value shows some of the values thesolution chaotically jumpsthrough.\label{fig:log_bif}" src="images/logistic_bifurc.png" /></p>
<p>For <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r &gt; r_\infty\)</span>, we observe a remarkable behavior found only in
nonlinear dynamical systems, called <em>chaos</em>. Chaos is characterized by
two qualities:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Aperiodic behavior: the dependent variable never repeats a value
exactly, instead bouncing around an infinite set of values for all
time</p></li>
<li><p>Sensitive dependence on initial conditions: no matter how close two
initial conditions in a chaotic system, given enough time the two
trajectories will diverge and lose any resemblance</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What is especially surprising about chaos is that for a given initial
condition a chaotic model gives a completely predictable and
reproducible sequence of values of the dependent variable. However,
given finite machine precision, or any error in initial conditions, a
chaotic system is practically unpredictable and irreproducible. But
there is a fundamental difference between deterministic chaos and a
stochastic system, e.g. the model of coin tosses where knowing the
previous result of the coin flip does not allow us to predict the next
result, even under ideal conditions.</p>
<p>Notice in figure , that for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r &gt; r_\infty\)</span>, chaotic
behavior is observed only for some values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>. As you can see in
figure , there are “bands of periodicity”, where the attractor is a
sequence of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> numbers (and periods of 3,5, etc. are observed),
alternating with bands of chaos. This illustrates that even the simplest
nonlinear discrete dynamical systems can have incredibly complex
behavior. When these results were first published by May in the 1970s,
they revolutionized both the mathematical understanding of dynamical
systems, and the field of theoretical biology. Chaos occurs only in
discrete-time dynamical systems with one variable, but for three or more
variables continuous time (ODE) dynamical systems also can behave
chaotically.</p>
<p>As a mathematical side-note, if one looks at the differences between
successive values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_n\)</span>, they behave like a geometric sequence,
getting smaller and smaller by a constant fraction:
$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\delta_n = \frac{r_{n}-r_{n-1}}{r_{n+1}-r_{n}}\)</span><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( It is a remarkable
fact that \)</span>\delta_n<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( approaches a constant value when \)</span>n<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\( gets large,
\)</span>4.6692…<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(, known as the Feigenbaum constant. It can be proven that
this constant is the same for other iterated maps with the same shape as
the downward parabola of the logistic map (e.g. \)</span>f(x) = \sin(x)$).
Explaining why this deep mathematical fact is true is far outside the
bounds of this course. [&#64;strogatz_nonlinear_2001]</p>
<p>Chaos was a popular topic back in the 1980s and 90s, and even inspired
popular books [&#64;gleick_chaos:_1988]. It is in fact remarkable that very
simple difference equations can have solutions of apparently great
complexity. This is intriguing because it appeals to a fairly universal
human desire for simple explanations for complicated phenomena. The
popular exposure to what was dubbed “chaos theory” (which is not an
actual mathematical topic) spawned some inaccurate cliches, such as “a
butterfly flapping its wings in South America can cause a hurricane to
form and hit Florida”. The image refers to the phenomenon of sensitive
dependence on initial conditions, but of course it is utterly ridiculous
to draw a causal arrow between a butterfly (one of an enumerable number
of things changing the “initial conditions”) and large-scale atmospheric
phenomena. While there is some evidence (citation) that weather patters
are complex systems that exhibit chaotic behavior, we lack the ability
to isolate and control all influences that may perturb it, so pinning it
on a butterfly is highly unconvincing.</p>
<p>Despite the initial flurry of excitement, so-called chaos theory has
failed to make a big impact on our understanding of complex biological
systems. Although it is still quite fascinating intellectually, a simple
model like the logistic model is not an adequate model for any realistic
population, particularly for large values of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> where the chaotic
behavior occurs. We now appreciate that the essential complexity of
biological system requires multiple interacting variables which cannot
be reduced to a single equation. However, there has been some successful
observation of chaotic behavior in a population of flour beetles, which
seemed to agree with predictions of a three-variable difference equation
model [&#64;costantino_chaotic_1997].</p>
<p>We have seen how graphical tools can be used to analyze and predict the
behavior of a discrete-time dynamical system. We investigated the
logistic model by finding the fixed points and analyzing their
stability. Together with analysis of the graph of the updating function
and making a cobweb plot, this allowed us to describe the dynamics of
population growth in the logistic model, without doing any “math”.
Together, analytical and graphical analysis provide powerful tools for
biological modelers.</p>
