## Part 1: Analysis through eigenvalues

For each of the six two-variable ODEs in problem set 4 do the following:

 - Produce a phase plane plot
 - Find the eigenvalues of the defining matrix and 
 - Classify the phase plane according to the eigenvalues.

### Part 2: Solutions in the phase plane

Modify the code provided in examples notebook to solve the ODEs, then put a *for loop* around the code in order to plot 6 separate solution trajectories starting from six initial
conditions which you set as two vectors before the loop begins. Your
results for each model should include: 
 
 - overlay the phase portrait with 6 different trajectories
 - plot 6 solutions of X in one window and 6 solutions of Y in another
 - comment on where *each variable* (X and Y) of the solution ends up, and whether/how it depends on the intial values
 - comment on how the classification you provided in part 1 is reflected in the dynamics of the solution trajectories
 
 Q2.1-6: Use the same models that you used in Q1.1-6.
